(Although I would just recommend downloading manually), you can install the theme and keep up to date by cloning the repo:

    git clone https://github.com/TanZboi/Dracula-for-FL-Studio-21.git

Download using the [GitHub .zip download](https://github.com/TanZboi/Dracula-for-FL-Studio-21/blob/master/Dracula.zip) option and unzip them.
